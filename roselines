The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem
As the perfumed tincture of the roses.
Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so;
Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?
Which, like a canker in the fragrant rose,
Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;
The roses fearfully on thorns did stand,
  Save thou, my rose, in it thou art my all.
I have seen roses damask'd, red and white,
But no such roses see I in her cheeks;
